# Code-Quiz

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

Code quiz requirements:

* A start button
    * when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
        * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
            * When question-button is clicked, the next question appears
            * If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
* When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
